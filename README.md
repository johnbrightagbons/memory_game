Overview
This is a basic "Hello World!" program that serves as a reinforcer of my understanding of python as a versatile and powerful programming language.

I created an "Hello World!" program using python. This program is designed to print the text "Hello World" to the console. I went a little further by declaring a variable called Myname to store my name "Bright" and use it in the print statement to output the text "Hello, Bright Welcome to the world of Python programming."

The purpose of this program is to strenghten my foundational knowledge of python. By starting with the basic, I can reassure myself that I still have a strong grasp of the syntax, basic functions and how to run a python program
