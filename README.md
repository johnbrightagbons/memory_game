Overview
This is an interactive browser-based memory matching game program, where the user has to match a pair of cards with the fewest number of moves and fastest possible time. This program was developed using HTML for the page structure, CSS for styling and animations and JavaScript for the game logic and interactivity. The game has a score tracker, a timer and a dynamic message using SweetAlert2 library.

The purpose of this program is to enhance my JavaScript skills, especially around DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and integrating external libraries like SweetAlert2. Building this from scratch strengthened my understanding of modular, maintainable frontend code and reinforced my confidence in JavaScript logic implementation.

Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to develop this project. VS Code supports multiple programming languages and has excellent extensions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Future Work

In the future I would like

1. Add sound effects for matches and wins
2. Add a Hint button to briefly reveal all unmatched cards
